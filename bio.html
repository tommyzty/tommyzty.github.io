<h1> Biography </h1>
<p>I am Tommy Zhu, a computer science student in Tufts University. I'm not very good at writing a bio, because my specialty is writing programs. I will try to find help in Tufts Career Center so that someone skillful in writing can help me write a good biography. For now, I'll just put random stuff here :) The things I like. </p>
